# Datainc

**Datainc** is an open-source, end-to-end data pipeline solution that harvests **alternative data sources** for marketing, advertising, and analytics use cases. Our goal is to empower brands, agencies, and analysts with non-traditional datasets (social media, call transcripts, geospatial insights, video transcripts, etc.) mapped to a robust marketing data model.

## Key Features
- **Modular Connectors**: Plug-and-play ingestion from Twitter, YouTube, Yelp, Twilio, maps, and more.
- **Transformations**: Built-in NLP for sentiment analysis, geospatial clustering, and marketing attribution modeling.
- **Marketing Data Model**: Standard schema to unify diverse data sources (campaigns, channels, creative assets).
- **Orchestration**: Ready-to-deploy workflows using Airflow (or your favorite orchestrator).
- **Open Source**: Community-driven, extensible, and free to modify.
